                        <h2>Why I don’t want to be a front-end web developer</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        As a front-end developer, you portray yourself as having a narrow set of skills. This probably isn’t
                        the case.<br>
                        I did a quick search on a popular job forum for front-end developer jobs, and there is a clear
                        recurring theme as to what skills are required to be a mid-level/senior front-end developer;
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML has remained relatively unchanged since it was invented in 1990. If you don’t agree, just take
                            a look at the source code for the first web page. HTML is easy, whatever the flavour. That’s
                            actually is greatest strength, no barrier to entry for new developers.</li>
                        <li>CSS is easy to learn, impossible to be great at. Thankfully tools such as SASS/SCSS and LESS are
                            eliminating the pain. A web developer of any skill level and experience can learn to use these CSS
                            pre-processors in 60 minutes or less. They’re simple. They just work.</li>
                        <li>If you’re good at responsive web design, this is a valuable skill. Thankfully, if, like me, you’re
                            not strong with design… front-end frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, help most developers
                            sweep this skill gap under the <rug class=""></rug></li>
                        <li>Photoshop is in a world of its own. Its ridiculous level of complexity is only matched by its mind
                            boggling feature set. Kudos if you can even get it to install and run.</li>
                        <li>Source control. All you need to know; <strong>git push</strong> and <strong>pull</strong>.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    My perception of these skills;<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(X)HTML (5), CSS, SASS/SCSS, LESS.</li>
                        <li>Backbone, Angular, Knockout.</li>
                        <li>Responsive web design (I’m assuming Bootstrap knowledge, Foundation etc).</li>
                        <li>Adobe Photoshop, Magento.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of source control and some form of client side unit testing.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    These are, of course, tongue-in-cheek observations. What I’m trying to say is that a full-stack
                    developer can be strong in all of these areas with minimal exposure and experience. These are not
                    specialist skills. This generalisation I think applies to JavaScript development too. After 3 months
                    of constant exposure to AngularJS, for example, you should have a good (if high level) understanding
                    of how it works, how to use it, when to use it, and most importantly, when not to use it.<br>
                    I don’t want to be a front-end developer because I have broader range of skills and I don’t want to
                    undersell <myself class=""></myself>

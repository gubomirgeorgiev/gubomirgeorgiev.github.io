                    <h2>Why I don’t want to be a front-end web developer</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    As a front-end developer, you portray yourself as having a narrow set of skills. This probably isn’t
                    the case.<br>
                    I did a quick search on a popular job forum for front-end developer jobs, and there is a clear
                    recurring theme as to what skills are required to be a mid-level/senior front-end developer;
                    <ul>
                <li>HTML has remained relatively unchanged since it was invented in 1990. If you don’t agree, just take
                    a look at the source code for the first web page. HTML is easy, whatever the flavour. That’s
                    actually is greatest strength, no barrier to entry for new developers.</li>
                <li>CSS is easy to learn, impossible to be great at. Thankfully tools such as SASS/SCSS and LESS are
                    eliminating the pain. A web developer of any skill level and experience can learn to use these CSS
                    pre-processors in 60 minutes or less. They’re simple. They just work.</li>
                <li>If you’re good at responsive web design, this is a valuable skill. Thankfully, if, like me, you’re
                    not strong with design… front-end frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, help most developers
                    sweep this skill gap under the <rug class=""></rug></li>
                <li>Photoshop is in a world of its own. Its ridiculous level of complexity is only matched by its mind
                    boggling feature set. Kudos if you can even get it to install and run.</li>
                <li>Source control. All you need to know; <strong>git push</strong> and <strong>pull</strong>.</li>
            </ul><br>
                My perception of these skills;<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>(X)HTML (5), CSS, SASS/SCSS, LESS.</li>
                    <li>Backbone, Angular, Knockout.</li>
                    <li>Responsive web design (I’m assuming Bootstrap knowledge, Foundation etc).</li>
                    <li>Adobe Photoshop, Magento.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of source control and some form of client side unit testing.</li>
                </ul><br>
                These are, of course, tongue-in-cheek observations. What I’m trying to say is that a full-stack
                developer can be strong in all of these areas with minimal exposure and experience. These are not
                specialist skills. This generalisation I think applies to JavaScript development too. After 3 months
                of constant exposure to AngularJS, for example, you should have a good (if high level) understanding
                of how it works, how to use it, when to use it, and most importantly, when not to use it.<br>
                I don’t want to be a front-end developer because I have broader range of skills and I don’t want to
                undersell <myself class=""></myself>

                    <h2>How to avoid burnout</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    You work hard 7 days a week, and you do your best to stay up to date with the latest industry
                    trends.  Inevitably you will become demoralized and demotivated and eventually suffer a partial
                    or full-on collapse where all your progress comes to a grinding halt.  After a period of time
                    (days, weeks or months!) you get back on track and pick up where you left off, eventually leading
                    to the inevitable burnout cycle where you end up back where you were.  I’ve been through this cycle
                    several times, and I’ve even blogged about it before, but now I have learnt the ultimate techniques
                    to break the endless cycle and find a more maintainable work-life balance.<br><br>
                    You probably can’t stop doing your day job, so you will want to give that the highest precedence.
                    However, I can’t tell you how many people I’ve met in my life who “forget” to take paid leave
                    (holiday days) on a regular basis.  I’ve known people who still have 15 or more holiday days
                    available in early December, and whom either lose those days or just take the money instead.
                    You should ensure that you regularly take some time off from work, at least once a quarter, and
                    actually have time to yourself or do something relaxing with close family and friends.<br><br>

                    If you’re doing online training on a regular basis, you shouldn’t stress about it.  Don’t try and
                    watch 12 hours of Pluralsight videos a 3x speed every night…stretch it out over a week or longer,
                    you will absorb the information better and ultimately get more from the training than you probably
                    will otherwise.<br><br>
                    Freelance or other paid work on top of your day job is a recipe for disaster.   The stress of
                    meeting additional deadlines, not being able to have face-to-face discussions with your client, and
                    generally working 15 hours a day will rapidly accelerate burnout.  Try not to take on freelance work
                    if possible, or try and cap it at 1 project at any one time.  The same goes for open source or
                    otherwise unpaid work.  Whilst typically not as stressful, the pressure of expectation can still sit
                    on your shoulders, so try and keep it to a minimum.<br>
